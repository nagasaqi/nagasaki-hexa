Vision is to make maximum out of minimum resources. I future using Multi-Pointer Aware backend, We hope to create a scalable and cheap synthesizer for all.\r\n\r\n![In Action - Screenshot](https://github.com/nagasaqi/nagasaqi-hexa/blob/master/Nagasaqi/src/in/nagasaqi/res/Screenshot%20from%202015-09-08%2002:18:41.png)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
